# Image Gallery with Click Animation

This project creates an interactive image gallery where each image can be clicked to trigger an animation. After the animation, the user is redirected to a corresponding link. The gallery loads images dynamically as the user scrolls down the page.

## Features
- A scrollable product gallery look.
- Dynamic loading of images.
- Clickable images that trigger an animation.
- Redirects to specified links after the animation ends.
- Responsive design with lazy loading for better performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have a modern web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- Place the required animation video file in an accessible location.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository or download the files** to your local machine.

2. **Include the JavaScript code** in your HTML file. You can do this by adding a `<script>` tag in the `<head>` or at the end of the `<body>` section of your HTML or by a <script src="path/to/your/script.js"></script>. If you are using wordpress, you can use an appropriate js code runner plugin and add the code there, while making sure the code only effects the desired page.





Customizing the Image and Link Arrays
The script uses two arrays:

array1: Contains the links to redirect to when an image is clicked.
array2: Contains the URLs of images to display.

Just edit the arrays to customise the gallery.
